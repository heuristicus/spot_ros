Robot Configuration
===========================

To configure the robot, you should consult `Boston Dynamics' support pages <https://support.bostondynamics.com/s/>`_.

Robot administration is performed through the `admin console <https://support.bostondynamics.com/s/article/Spot-system-administration>`_.

Networking
----------------

See the `network setup <https://support.bostondynamics.com/s/article/Spot-network-setup>`_ pages for details on network configuration.

Using WiFi for ROS communication is not recommended, except for monitoring purposes.

The driver can output a lot of data. It is recommended that you connect the Spot to the ROS PC via a payload port. See the `payload developer guide <https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/payload/readme>`_ for details.
